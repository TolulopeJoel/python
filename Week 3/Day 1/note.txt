Functions:
Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task when called.
They help in organizing and simplifying your code by breaking it into smaller, manageable pieces.

Parameters:
Parameters are values or variables that you can pass to a function when calling it.
They allow functions to work with different inputs, making the code more flexible and reusable.

Positional Arguments:
Positional arguments are the most common way to pass parameters to a function.
They are matched with the function's parameters based on their order.

Keyword Arguments:
Keyword arguments are passed to a function using the parameter names as keywords.
They allow you to specify which parameter should receive which value, making function calls more explicit and readable.


Examples:

def greet(name, message):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! {message}")

# Using positional arguments
greet("Alice", "How are you?")

# Using keyword arguments
greet(message="What's up?", name="Bob")
