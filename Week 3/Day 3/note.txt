Function Documentation:
Function documentation, often referred to as docstrings, provides a brief explanation of what a function does, its parameters, and return values.
It helps users understand how to use the function and its purpose.
Proper documentation enhances code readability and collaboration.

Global vs. Local Variables:
Global variables are defined outside of any function and can be accessed from any part of the code.
Local variables are defined within a specific function and are only accessible within that function's scope.
Global variables should be used sparingly to avoid unintended side effects and ensure code clarity.

Global Keyword:
The "global" keyword in Python is used to declare a variable as global within a function.
It allows you to modify a global variable from within a function's scope.
However, it's generally considered a best practice to minimize the use of global variables to maintain code clarity and prevent unintended side effects.

Lambda Functions:
Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are concise, one-line functions defined using the "lambda" keyword.
They are often used for small, simple operations and can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions.
Lambda functions are useful for quick, throwaway functions without the need for a formal function definition.
