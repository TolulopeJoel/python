To retrieve a value from a dictionary,
you obtain it using its corresponding key.

Example:
Suppose we have a dictionary named `person` with the entry {"name": "James"}.
(person = {"name": "James"})
To obtain the value associated with the key "name",
you would use `person["name"]`, which returns "James".


In 1_dictionaries.py, the last nested for loop explained:

- The first loop iterates through the dictionary `students`. `s` represents the keys (student names) in the dictionary.
- The second loop iterates through each key-value pair within each student dictionary in the list `students`.
- The variable `student` represents each dictionary in the list of student dictionaries.
- The variable `info` represents each key (attribute) within the current student dictionary.

This approach allows you to access and print the information stored in dictionaries within a loop.

Dictionary with For Loop:
You can use a for loop to iterate through a dictionary's keys, values, or key-value pairs.
The loop simplifies accessing and processing the data stored in the dictionary.
