always ask user for withdrawal amount till they quit

when you ask user for withdrawal amount, check if it is greater than the account balance

if it is greater than account balance, stop the code

but if it is not (less than account balance), subtract the withdrawal amount
from the account balance and show the user

then ask user again if they want to withdraw

if yes, continue
if no, stop the code
