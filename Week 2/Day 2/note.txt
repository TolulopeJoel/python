Enumerate:
The enumerate function adds a counter to an iterable (like a list or string) and returns an iterator of pairs containing the counter and the value from the iterable.
It's useful for obtaining both the index and value during iteration.

We saw an example of this in our 3_enumerate.py file when we used it in the shopping_cart list
(0, 'milk')
(1, 'cereal')
(2, 'beans')
(3, 'corn')

Range:
The range function generates a sequence of numbers within a specified range.
It's often used in loops to define the number of iterations or to create lists of numbers.
