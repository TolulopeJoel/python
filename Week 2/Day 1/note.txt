While Loop:
A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

For Loop:
A for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list,or string) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

Break:
The 'break' statement is used within loops to immediately exit the loop, regardless of whether the loop's condition is still true.

Continue:
The continue statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the while loop.
The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop.
